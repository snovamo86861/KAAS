# Create a Repository



- In this activity, we will create a Github repository and add group members as collaborators.

# Instructions


- One group member should create a new Github repository. Don't worry about the project name now, this can be changed later.


- From the repo's main page, click the "Settings" tab.


- Once in the repo's settings, select the "Collaborators" menu item on the left.


- From the "Collaborators" page, invite your group members to be project collaborators by entering their Github usernames one at a time.


- Each invited group member should receive an email they must open to accept the invitation.



# Students Do: Protect Master Branch
In this activity, we will protect our repo's master branch.

# Instructions


- Only one member per project group needs to complete this activity.


- Navigate back to the repo's "Settings" page and then select "Branches" from the left sidebar.


- Under "Branch Protection Rules" select "master" from the dropdown.


- You should be presented with some options, check off the following:


- "Protect this branch"


- "Require pull request reviews before merging"


- "Include administrators"





- If completed successfully, no one should be able to push directly to the master branch. Instead, all changes must be made in the form of pull requests that are to be reviewed by another group member.
